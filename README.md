# DungeonCraft
A 2D dungeon crawler game leveraging HTML5 Canvas and ReactJS through a simple game engine featuring collision detection and procedural generation. Play your way through 10 levels for a change to fight the final boss and escape.

## How to run
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Build the project using `npm run build`.
3. Navigate to the `./build` folder and run `index.html`.

## How to play
The player can be moved around using standard `WASD` keyboard controls. Each level must be cleared of enemies before the escape door will allow progress to the next dungeon. Enemies are fought by moving onto the same tile they are on and power-ups picked up in the same manner.
